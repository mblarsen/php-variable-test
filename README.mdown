A simple script that outputs a table of how PHP evalutaes variables and boolean operations. For example:

	false < true = ?
	
or

	count(true) = ?
	
or 

	'1' == 1 = ?

The script is strongly inspired by (read rip-off) [this page](http://www.deformedweb.co.uk/php_variable_tests.php "PHP Variable and Array Tests") by Barray.
